### Future Goals

* I'd like to map the colors a little bit better
  * Red Buttons don't look like they belong
* Rounder Buttons
* Remove Semantic UI
  * Uses a lot of `!important`
  * Is a pain to overwrite
  * Removing it would let me drop some custom templates
  * I'm a bigger fan of Bulma
  * If I use another css I'll use purgecss to remove anything I don't need
